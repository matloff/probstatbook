\chapter{Covariance and Random Vectors} 
\label{randvec}

Most applications of probability and statistics involve the
\underline{interaction} between variables.  For instance, when you buy a
book at Amazon.com, the software will likely inform you of other books
that people bought in conjunction with the one you selected.  Amazon is
relying on the fact that sales of certain pairs or groups of books are
correlated.

Thus we need the notion of distributions that describe how two or more
variables vary together.  This chapter develops that notion, {\bf which
forms the very core of statistics}.

\section{Measuring Co-variation of Random Variables}

\subsection{Covariance}
\label{covar}

\begin{definition}
The {\bf covariance} between random variables X and Y is defined as

\begin{equation}
\label{covdef}
Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-EX) (Y-EY)]
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Suppose that typically when X is larger than its mean, Y is also larger
than its mean, and vice versa for below-mean values.  Then (\ref{covdef})
will likely be positive.  In other words, if X and Y are positively
correlated (a term we will define formally later but keep intuitive for
now), then their covariance is positive.  Similarly, if X is often smaller
than its mean whenever Y is larger than its mean, the covariance and
correlation between them will be negative.  All of this is roughly
speaking, of course, since it depends on {\it how much} and {\it how
often} X is larger or
smaller than its mean, etc.

{\bf Linearity in both arguments:}

\begin{equation}
\label{covlin}
Cov(aX+bY,cU+dV) = ac Cov(X,U) + ad Cov(X,V) + bc Cov(Y,U) + bd Cov(Y,V) 
\end{equation}

for any constants a, b, c and d.  

{\bf Insensitivity to additive constants:}

\begin{equation}
\label{covq}
Cov(X,Y+q) = Cov(X,Y)
\end{equation}

for any constant q and so on.

{\bf Covariance of a random variable with itself:}

\begin{equation}
\label{selfcov}
Cov(X,X) = Var(X)
\end{equation}

for any X with finite variance.

{\bf Shortcut calculation of covariance:}

\begin{equation}
\label{shortcut}
Cov(X,Y) = E(XY) - EX \cdot EY
\end{equation}

The proof will help you review some important issues, namely (a) E(U+V)
= EU + EV, (b) E(cU) = c EU and Ec = c for any constant c, and (c) EX
and EY are constants in (\ref{shortcut}).

\begin{eqnarray}
Cov(X,Y) &=& E[(X-EX) (Y-EY) ] ~~ \textrm{(definition)}\\
&=& E \left [ XY - EX \cdot Y - EY \cdot X + EX \cdot EY \right ] ~~
\textrm{(algebra)} \\ 
&=& E(XY) + E[- EX \cdot Y] + E[- EY \cdot X] + E[EX \cdot EY ] ~~
\textrm{(E[U+V]=EU+EV)} \\ 
&=& E(XY) - EX \cdot EY ~~ \textrm{(E[cU] = cEU, Ec = c)}
\end{eqnarray}

{\bf Variance of sums:}

\begin{equation}
\label{genvarxplusy}
Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2 Cov(X,Y)
\end{equation}

This comes from (\ref{shortcut}), the relation $Var(X) = E(X^2) - EX^2$ 
and the corresponding one for Y.  Just substitute and do the algebra.

By induction, (\ref{genvarxplusy}) generalizes for more than two variables:

\begin{equation}
\label{varmultsum}
Var(W_1+...+W_r) =
\sum_{i=1}^r Var(W_i) +
2 \sum_{1 \leq j < i \leq r} Cov(W_i,W_j)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Example:  Variance of Sum of Nonindependent Variables}
\label{simpleex}

Consider random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$, for which $Var(X_i) = 1.0$
for i = 1,2, and $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0.5$.  Let's find $Var(X_1+X_2)$.

This is quite straightforward, from (\ref{genvarxplusy}):

\begin{equation}
Var(X_1+X_2) = Var(X_1) + Var(X_2) + 2 Cov(X_1,X_2) = 3
\end{equation}

\subsection{Example:  the Committee Example Again}

Let's find Var(M) in the committee example of Section \ref{combex}.  In
(\ref{massum}), we wrote M as a sum of indicator random variables:

\begin{equation}
\label{massum2}
M = G_1 + G_2 + G_3 + G_4 
\end{equation}

and found that

\begin{equation}
P(G_i = 1) = \frac{2}{3}
\end{equation}

for all i.  

You should review why this value is the same for all i, as
this reasoning will be used again below.  Also review Section
\ref{indicator}.

Applying (\ref{varmultsum}) to (\ref{massum2}), we have

\begin{equation}
\label{varm}
Var(M) = 4 Var(G_1) + 12 Cov(G_1.G_2)
\end{equation}

Finding that first term is easy, from (\ref{varofeqp1p}):

\begin{equation}
Var(G_1) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \left ( 1 - \frac{2}{3} \right ) =
\frac{2}{9}
\end{equation}

Now, what about $Cov(G_1.G_2)$?  Equation (\ref{shortcut}) will be handy here:

\begin{equation}
\label{covg1g2}
Cov(G_1.G_2) = E(G_1 G_2) - E(G_1) E(G_2)
\end{equation}

That first term in (\ref{covg1g2}) is 

\begin{eqnarray}
E(G_1 G_2) &=& P(G_1 = 1 \textrm{ and } G_2 = 1) \\ 
&=& P(\textrm{choose a man on both the first and second pick)} \\
&=& \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{5}{8} \\
&=& \frac{5}{12} 
\end{eqnarray}

That second term in (\ref{covg1g2}) is, again from Section
\ref{indicator},

\begin{equation}
\left (
\frac{2}{3}
\right )^2 = \frac{4}{9}
\end{equation}

All that's left is to put this together in (\ref{varm}), left to the
reader.

\section{Correlation}
\label{correlation}

Covariance does measure how much or little X and Y vary together, but it
is hard to decide whether a given value of covariance is ``large'' or
not.  For instance, if we are measuring lengths in feet and change to
inches, then (\ref{covlin}) shows that the covariance will increase by
$12^2 = 144$.  Thus it makes sense to scale covariance according to the
variables' standard deviations.  Accordingly, the {\it correlation}
between two random variables X and Y is defined by

\begin{equation}
\label{rhodef}
\rho(X,Y) = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}
{\sqrt{Var(X)} \sqrt{Var(Y)}}
\end{equation}

So, correlation is unitless, i.e. does not involve units like feet,
pounds, etc.

It is shown later in this chapter that 

\begin{itemize}

\item $-1 \leq \rho(X,Y) \leq 1$

\item  $|\rho(X,Y)| = 1$ if and only if X and Y are exact linear functions
of each other, i.e. Y = cX + d for some constants c and d
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example:  a Catchup Game}
\label{catchupgame}

Consider the following simple game.  There are two players, who take
turns playing.  One's position after k turns is the sum of one's
winnings in those turns.  Basically, a turn consists of generating a
random U(0,1) variable, with one difference---if that player is
currently losing, he gets a bonus of 0.2 to help him catch up.  

Let X and Y be the total winnings of the two players after 10 turns.
Intuitively, X and Y should be positively correlated, due to the 0.2
bonus which brings them closer together.  Let's see if this is true.

Though very simply stated, this problem is far too tough to solve
mathematically in an elementary course (or even an advanced one).  So,
we will use simulation.  In addition to finding the correlation between
X and Y, we'll also find $F_{X,Y}(5.8,5.2) = 
P(X \leq 5.8 \textrm{ and } Y \leq 5.2)$. 

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2},numbers=left]
taketurn <- function(a,b) {
   win <- runif(1)
   if (a >= b) return(win)
   else return(win+0.2)
}

nturns <- 10
xyvals <- matrix(nrow=nreps,ncol=2)
for (rep in 1:nreps) {
   x <- 0
   y <- 0
   for (turn in 1:nturns) {
      # x's turn
      x <- x + taketurn(x,y)
      # y's turn
      y <- y + taketurn(y,x)
   }
   xyvals[rep,] <- c(x,y)
}
print(cor(xyvals[,1],xyvals[,2]))
\end{Verbatim}

The output is 0.65.  So, X and Y are indeed positively correlated as we
had surmised.

Note the use of R's built-in function {\bf cor()} to compute
correlation, a shortcut that allows us to avoid summing all the products
{\bf xy} and so on, from (\ref{shortcut}).  The reader should make sure
he/she understands how this would be done.

\section{Sets of Independent Random Variables}

Recall from Section \ref{indepdef}:

\begin{definition}

Random variables X and Y are said to be {\bf independent} if for any
sets I and J, the events \{X is in I\} and \{Y is in J\} are 
independent, i.e.  P(X is in I and Y is in J) = P(X is in I) P(Y is in
J). 

\end{definition}

Intuitively, though, it simply means that knowledge of the value of X
tells us nothing about the value of Y, and vice versa.

Great mathematical tractability can be achieved by assuming that the
$X_i$ in a random vector $X = (X_1,...,X_k)$ are independent.  In many
applications, this is a reasonable assumption.

\subsection{Properties}

In the next few sections, we will look at some commonly-used properties
of sets of independent random variables.  For simplicity, consider the
case k = 2, with X and Y being independent (scalar) random variables.

\subsubsection{Expected Values Factor}

If X and Y are independent, then 

\begin{equation}
\label{evalfactors}
E(XY) = E(X) E(Y)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Covariance Is 0}

If X and Y are independent, we have

\begin{equation}
\label{cov0}
Cov(X,Y) = 0
\end{equation}

and thus

$\rho(X,Y) = 0$ as well.

This follows from (\ref{evalfactors}) and (\ref{shortcut}).

However, the converse is false.  A counterexample is the random pair
$(X,Y)$ that is uniformly distributed on the unit disk, $\{(s,t):
s^2+t^2 \leq 1\}$.  Clearly 0 = E(XY) = EX = EY due to the symmetry of
the distribution about (0,0), so Cov(X,Y) = 0 by (\ref{shortcut}).  

But X and Y just as clearly are not independent.  If for example we know that
$X > 0.8$, say, then $Y^2 < 1 - 0.8^2$ and thus $|Y| < 0.6$.  If X and Y
were independent, knowledge of X should not tell us anything about Y,
which is not the case here, and thus they are not independent.  If we
also know that X and Y are bivariate normally distributed (Section
\ref{mvnormdens}), then zero covariance does imply independence.

\subsubsection{Variances Add}

If X and Y are independent, then we have

\begin{equation}
\label{covsadd}
Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y).
\end{equation}

This follows from (\ref{genvarxplusy}) and (\ref{evalfactors}). 

\subsection{Examples Involving Sets of Independent Random Variables}

\subsubsection{Example:  Dice}
\label{diceex}

In Section \ref{catchupgame}, we speculated that the correlation between
X, the number on the blue die, and S, the total of the two dice, was
positive.  Let's compute it.

Write S = X + Y, where Y is the number on the yellow die.  Then
using the properties of covariance presented above, we have that 

\begin{eqnarray}
Cov(X,S) &=& Cov(X,X+Y) ~~ (\textrm{def. of S}) \\ 
&=& Cov(X,X) + Cov(X,Y) ~~ (\textrm{from } (\ref{covlin})) \\
&=& Var(X) + 0 ~~ (\textrm{from } (\ref{selfcov}),~ (\ref{cov0}))
\end{eqnarray}

Also, from (\ref{covsadd}),

\begin{equation}
Var(S) =  Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)
\end{equation}

But Var(Y) = Var(X).  So the correlation between X and S is

\begin{equation}
\rho(X,S) = \frac{Var(X)}
{\sqrt{Var(X)} \sqrt{2Var(X)}} = 0.707
\end{equation}

Since correlation is at most 1 in absolute value, 0.707 is considered a
fairly high correlation.  Of course, we did expect X and S to be highly
correlated.

\subsubsection{Example:  Variance of a Product}

Suppose $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent random variables with $EX_i =
\mu_i$ and $Var(X_i) = \sigma^2_i$, i = 1,2.  Let's find an expression
for $Var(X_1 X_2)$.

\begin{eqnarray}
Var(X_1 X_2) &=& E(X^2_1 X^2_2) - [E(X_1 X_2)]^2 ~~~~ 
   \textrm{(\ref{varuformula})}  \\ 
&=& E(X^2_1) \cdot E(X^2_2) - \mu^2_1 \mu^2_2 
   ~~~~ \textrm{(\ref{evalfactors})} \\
&=& (\sigma^2_1 + \mu^2_1) (\sigma^2_2 + \mu^2_2) - \mu^2_1 \mu^2_2 \\
&=& \sigma^2_1 \sigma^2_2 
+ \mu^2_1 \sigma^2_2
+ \mu^2_2 \sigma^2_1
\end{eqnarray}

Note that $E(X^2_1) = \sigma^2_1 + \mu^2_1$ by virtue of
(\ref{varuformula}).

\subsubsection{Example:  Ratio of Independent Geometric Random Variables}

Suppose X and Y are independent geometrically distributed
random variables with success probability p.  Let Z = X/Y.  We are
interested in EZ and $F_Z$.

First, by (\ref{evalfactors}), we have

\begin{eqnarray}
EZ &=& E(X \cdot \frac{1}{Y}) \\ 
&=& EX \cdot E(\frac{1}{Y}) ~~~~ (\ref{evalfactors}) \\ 
&=& \frac{1}{p} \cdot E(\frac{1}{Y}) ~~~~ \textrm{(mean of geom is 1/p)} 
\end{eqnarray}

So we need to find E(1/Y).  Using (\ref{egofx}), we have

\begin{equation}
E(\frac{1}{Y}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i} (1-p)^{i-1} p
\end{equation}



Unfortunately, no further simplification seems possible.

Now let's find $F_Z(m)$ for a positive integer m.

\begin{eqnarray}
F_Z(m) &=& P \left (\frac{X}{Y} \leq m \right ) \\ 
&=& P(X \leq mY) \\ 
&=& \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(Y = i) ~ P(X \leq mY | Y = i) \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (1-p)^{i-1} p ~ P(X \leq mi) \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} (1-p)^{i-1} p ~ [1 - (1-p)^{mi}]
\label{mess}
\end{eqnarray}

this last step coming from (\ref{geomcdf}).

We can actually reduce (\ref{mess}) to closed form, by writing

\begin{equation}
(1-p)^{i-1} (1-p)^{mi} =  (1-p)^{mi+i-1} = \frac{1}{1-p}
\left [ (1-p)^{m+1} \right ]^i
\end{equation}

and then using (\ref{infgeom}).  Details are left to the reader.

\section{Matrix Formulations}
\label{matrix}

(Note that there is a review of matrix algebra in Appendix
\ref{chap:matrixreview}.)

In your first course in matrices and linear algebra, your instructor
probably motivated the notion of a matrix by using an example involving
linear equations, as follows.

Suppose we have a system of equations

\begin{equation}
\label{linsyst}
a_{i1} x_1 + ... + a_{in} x_{n} = b_i, ~~ i = 1,...,n,
\end{equation}

where the $x_i$ are the unknowns to be solved for.

This system can be represented compactly as

\begin{equation}
\label{lin}
AX = B,
\end{equation}

where A is nxn and X and B are nx1.

That compactness coming from the matrix formulation applies to
statistics too, though in different ways, as we will see.  (Linear
algebra in general is used widely in statistics---matrices, rank and
subspace, eigenvalues, even determinants.)

When dealing with multivariate distributions, some very messy equations
can be greatly compactified through the use of matrix algebra.  We will
introduce this here.

Throughout this section, consider a random vector $W = (W_1,...,W_k)'$
where $'$ denotes matrix transpose, and a vector written horizontally like
this without a $'$ means a row vector.

\subsection{Properties of Mean Vectors}

In statistics, we frequently need to find covariance matrices of linear
combinations of random vectors.

\begin{definition}

The expected value of W is defined to be the vector

\begin{equation}
\label{evalrandvec}
EW = (EW_1,...,EW_k)'
\end{equation}

\end{definition}

The linearity of the components implies that of the vectors:  

For any scalar constants c and d, and any random vectors V and W, we
have

\begin{equation}
E(cV+dW) = c EV + d EW
\end{equation}

where the multiplication and equality is now in the vector sense.

Also, multiplication by a constant matrix factors:  

If A is a nonrandom matrix having k columns, then

\begin{equation}
\label{eaw}
E(AW) = A EW
\end{equation}

\subsection{Covariance Matrices}

\begin{definition}
The covariance matrix Cov(W) of $W = (W_1,...,W_k)'$
is the k x k matrix whose $(i,j)^{th}$ element is $Cov(W_i,W_j)$.  
\end{definition}

Note that that implies that the diagonal elements of the matrix are the
variances of the $W_i$, and that the matrix is symmetric.  

As you can see, in the statistics world, the Cov() notation is
``overloaded.''  If it has two arguments, it is ordinary covariance,
between two variables.  If it has one argument, it is the covariance
matrix, consisting of the covariances of all pairs of components in the
argument.  When people mean the matrix form, they always say so, i.e.
they say ``covariance MATRIX'' instead of just ``covariance.''

The covariance matrix is just a way to compactly do operations on
ordinary covariances.  Here are some important properties:

Say c is a constant scalar.  Then cW is a
k-component random vector like W, and 

\begin{equation}
\label{c2cov}
Cov(cW) = c^2 Cov(W)
\end{equation}

Suppose V and W are independent random vectors, meaning that each
component in V is independent of each component of W.  (But this does
NOT mean that the components within V are independent of each other, and
similarly for W.)  Then

\begin{equation}
\label{vectorsumcov}
Cov(V + W) = Cov(V) + Cov(W) 
\end{equation}

Of course, this is also true for sums of any (nonrandom) number of
independent random vectors.

In analogy with (\ref{varuformula}), for any
random vector Q,

\begin{equation}
\label{quickcovarmat}
Cov(Q) = E(Q Q') - EQ ~ (EQ)'
\end{equation}

\subsection{Covariance Matrices Linear Combinations of Random Vectors}

Suppose A is an r x k but nonrandom matrix.  Then AW is an r-component
random vector, with its i$^{th}$ element being a linear combination of
the elements of W.  Then one can show that

\begin{equation}
\label{covawaprime}
Cov(AW) = A ~ Cov(W)  ~A'
\end{equation}

An important special case is that in which A consists of just one row.
In this case AW is a vector of length 1---a scalar!  And its covariance
matrix, which is of size $1 \times 1$, is thus simply the variance of
that scalar.  In other words:

\begin{quote}

Suppose we have a random vector $U = (U_1,...,U_k)'$ and are interested
in the variance of a linear combination of the elements of U, 

\begin{equation}
\label{quadform1}
Y = c_1 U_1 + ...+ c_k U_k
\end{equation}

for a vector of constants $c = (c_1,...,c_k)'$.

Then

\begin{equation}
\label{quadform2}
Var(Y) =  c'Cov(U) c
\end{equation}

\end{quote}

\subsection{Example: (X,S) Dice Example Again}

Recall Sec. \ref{diceex}.  We rolled two dice, getting X and Y dots, and
set S to X+Y.  We then found $\rho(X,S)$.  Let's find
$\rho(X,S)$ using matrix methods.

The key is finding a proper choice for A in (\ref{covawaprime}).  A
little thought shows that

\begin{equation}
   \left (
   \begin{array}{r}
   X \\
   S \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
   =
   \left (
   \begin{array}{rr}
   1 & 0 \\
   1 & 1 \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
   \left (
   \begin{array}{r}
   X \\
   Y \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
\end{equation}

Thus the covariance matrix of (X,S)' is

\begin{eqnarray}
Cov[(X,S)']&=& 
   \left (
   \begin{array}{rr}
   1 & 0 \\
   1 & 1 \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
   \left (
   \begin{array}{cc}
   Var(X) & 0 \\
   0 & Var(Y) \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
   \left (
   \begin{array}{rr}
   1 & 1 \\
   0 & 1 \\
   \end{array}
   \right ) \\
&=&
   \left (
   \begin{array}{cc}
   Var(X) & 0 \\
   Var(X) & Var(Y) \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
   \left (
   \begin{array}{rr}
   1 & 1 \\
   0 & 1 \\
   \end{array}
   \right ) \\ 
&=&
   \left (
   \begin{array}{cc}
   Var(X) & Var(X) \\
   Var(X) & Var(X) + Var(Y) \\
   \end{array}
   \right )
\end{eqnarray}

since X and Y are independent.  We would then proceed as before.

This matches what we found earlier, as it should, but shows how matrix
methods can be used.  This example was fairly simple, so those methods
did not produce a large amount of streamlining, but in other examples
later in the book, the matrix approach will be key.

\subsection{Example:  Easy Sum Again}

Let's redo the example in Section \ref{simpleex} again, this time using
matrix methods.

First note that

\begin{equation}
X_1 + X_2 = (1,1) 
\left (
\begin{array}{r}
X_1 \\
X_2 \\
\end{array}
\right )
\end{equation}

i.e. it is of the form (\ref{quadform1}).  So, (\ref{quadform2}) gives
us

\begin{equation}
\label{easyvar}
Var(X_1 + X_2) =
(1,1)
\left (
\begin{array}{rr}
1 & 0.5 \\
0.5 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right )
\left (
\begin{array}{r}
1 \\
1 \\
\end{array}
\right )
= 3
\end{equation}

Of course using the matrix formulation didn't save us much time here,
but for complex problems it's invaluable.  We will frequently have need
for finding the variance of a linear combination of the elements of a
vector, exactly what we did above.

\section{The Multivariate Normal Family of Distributions}
\label{multnorm}

This is a generalization of the normal distribution.  It is covered in
detail in Section \ref{multnormal}, but here is the overview:

\begin{itemize}

\item Just as the univariate normal family is parameterized by the mean and
variance, the multivariate normal family has as its parameters the mean
{\it vector} and the covariance {\it matrix}.  

\item In the bivariate case, the density looks like a three-dimensional
bell, as on the cover of this book.

\item If a random vector W has a multivariate normal distribution, and A
is a constant matrix, then the new random vector AW is also multivariate
normally distributed.

\item The multivariate version of the Central Limit Theorem holds, i.e.
the sum of i.i.d. random vectors has an approximate multivariate normal
distribution.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{R Functions}

R provides functions that compute probabilities involving this family of
distributions, in the library {\bf mvtnorm}.  In particular  the R
function {\bf pmvnorm()}, which computes probabilities of
``rectangular'' regions for multivariate normally distributed random
vectors W.  The arguments we'll use for this function here are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf mean}: the mean vector

\item {\bf sigma}: the covariance matrix

\item {\bf lower, upper}: bounds for a multidimensional ``rectangular''
region of interest

\end{itemize}

Since a multivariate normal distribution is characterized by its mean
vector and covariance matrix, the first two arguments above shouldn't
suprise you.  But what about the other two?

The function finds the probability of our random vector falling into a
multidimensional rectangular region that we specify, through the
arguments are {\bf lower} and {\bf upper}.  For example, suppose we have
a trivariate normally distributed random vector $(U,V,W)'$, and we
want to find 

\begin{equation}
P( 1.2 < U < 5 \textrm{ and } -2.2 < V < 3 \textrm{ and } 1 < W < 10)
\end{equation}

Then {\bf lower} would be (1.2,-2.2,1) and {\bf upper} would be
(5,3,10).

Note that these will typically be specified via R's {\bf c()} function,
but default values are recycled versions of {\bf -Inf} and {\bf Inf},
built-in R constants for $-\infty$ and $\infty$.

An important special case is that in which we specify {\bf upper}
but allow {\bf lower} to be the default values, thus computing a
probability of the form

\begin{equation}
P(W_1 \leq c_1,...,W_r \leq c_r)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Special Case: New Variable Is a Single Linear Combination of
a Random Vector} 
\label{singlelincomb}

Suppose the vector $U = (U_1,...,U_k)'$ has an approximately k-variate
normal distribution, and we form the scalar

\begin{equation}
Y = c_1 U_1 + ...+ c_k U_k
\end{equation}

Then Y is approximately univate normal, and its (exact) variance is
given by (\ref{quadform2}).  It's mean is obtained via (\ref{eaw}).

We can then use the R functions for the univariate normal distribution,
e.g. {\bf pnorm()}.

\section{Indicator Random Vectors}
\label{indicvecs}

Let's extend the notion of indicator random variables in Section
\ref{indicator} to vectors.

Say one of events $A_1,...,A_k$ must occur, and they are disjoint.  So,
their probabilities sum to 1.  Define the k-component random vector I to
consist of k-1 0s and one 1, where the position of the 1 is itself
random; if $A_i$ occurs, then $I_i$ is 1.

For example, say U has a U(0,1) distribution, and say $A_1$, $A_2$ and
$A_3$ are the events corresponding to $U < 0.2$, $0.2 \leq U \leq 0.7$
and $U > 0.7$, respectively.  Then the random vector I would be
$(1,0,0)'$ in the first case, and so on.  

Let $p_i = P(A_i)$.  The analogs of (\ref{eofxeqp}) and
(\ref{varofeqp1p}) can easily be shown to be as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item The mean vector is $E(I) = (p_1,...,p_k)'$.

\item Cov(I) has $p_i(1-p_i)$ as its i$^{th}$ element, and for 
$i \neq j$, element (i,j) is $-p_i p_j$.

\end{itemize}

\section{Example:  Dice Game}
\label{dicegame}

This example will be short on some details, but it will really
illustrate the value of using matrices.

Suppose we roll a die 50 times.  Let X denote the number of rolls in
which we get one dot, and let Y be the number of times we get either two
or three dots.  For convenience, let's also define Z to be the number of
times we get four or more dots.  Suppose also that we win \$5 for each
roll of a one, and \$2 for each roll of a two or three. 

Let's find the approximate values of the following:

\begin{itemize}

\item $P(X \leq 12 \textrm{ and } Y \leq 16)$

\item P(win more than \$90)

\item $P(X > Y > Z)$

\end{itemize}

The exact probabilities could, in principle, be calculated.  But that
would be rather cumbersome.  But we can get approximate answers by
noting that the triple (X,Y,Z) has an approximate multivariate normal
distribution.  This is shown in Section \ref{multnormal}, but it
basically the derivation works like this:

\begin{itemize}

\item Write (X,Y,Z) as a sum of indicator vectors (Section
\ref{indicvecs}), analogous to what we did in Section \ref{binom}.

\item Invoke the multivariate CLT.

\end{itemize}

Since the parameters of the multivariate normal family are the mean
vector and the covariance matrix, we'll of course need to know those for
the random vector $(X,Y,Z)'$ when we call {\bf pmvnorm()}.  Once again,
this will be shown later, but basically it follows from Section
\ref{indicvecs} above.  Here are the results:

\begin{equation}
E[(X,Y,Z)] = (50/6, 50/3, 50/2)
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
Cov[(X,Y,Z)] =  
50
\begin{pmatrix}
5/36 & -1/18 & -1/12 \\
-1/18 & 2/9 & -1/6 \\
-1/12 & -1/6 & 1/4 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Here's a partial check:  X has a binomial distribution with 50 trials
and success probability 1/6, so (\ref{binvar}) tells us that Var(X) =
250/36, just as seen above.

We can now use the R multivariate normal probability function mentioned
in Section \ref{multnorm} to find $P(X \leq 12 \textrm{ and } Y \leq
16)$.

To account for the integer nature of X and Y, we call the function with
upper limits of 12.5 and 16.5, rather than 12 and 16, which is often
used to get a better approximation.  (Recall the ``correction for
continuity,'' Section \ref{correctcontin}.) Our code is

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\relsize{-2},numbers=left]
p1 <- 1/6
p23 <- 1/3
meanvec <- 50*c(p1,p23)
var1 <- 50*p1*(1-p1)
var23 <- 50*p23*(1-p23)
covar123 <- -50*p1*p23
covarmat <- matrix(c(var1,covar123,covar123,var23),nrow=2)
print(pmvnorm(upper=c(12.5,16.5),mean=meanvec,sigma=covarmat))
\end{Verbatim}

We find that 

\begin{equation}
P(X \leq 12 \textrm{ and } Y \leq 16) \approx 0.43
\end{equation}

Now, let's find the probability that our total winnings, T, is over
\$90.  We know that T = 5X + 2Y, and Section \ref{singlelincomb} above
applies.  We simply choose the vector {\bf c} to be

\begin{equation}
c = (5,2,0)'
\end{equation}

since

\begin{equation}
(5,2,0) 
\left (
\begin{array}{c}
X \\
Y \\
Z 
\end{array}
\right )
=  5X + 2Y
\end{equation}

Then Section \ref{singlelincomb} tells us that 5X + 2Y also has an
approximate univariate normal distribution.  Excellent---we can now use
{\bf pnorm()}.  We thus need the mean and variance of T, again using
Section \ref{singlelincomb}:

\begin{equation}
ET = E(5X+2Y) = 5 EX + 2 EY = 250/6 + 100/3 = 75
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
Var(T) =
c' ~ Cov
\left (
\begin{array}{c}
X \\
Y \\
Z 
\end{array}
\right )
c
=
(5,2,0) ~
50 ~
\left (
\begin{array}{rrr}
5/36 & -1/18 & -1/12 \\
-1/18 & 2/9 & -1/6 \\
-1/12 & -1/6 & 1/4 
\end{array}
\right )
\left (
\begin{array}{r}
5 \\
2 \\
0 \\
\end{array}
\right )
= 162.5
\end{equation}

So, we have our answer:

\begin{lstlisting}
> 1 - pnorm(90,75,sqrt(162.5))
[1] 0.1196583
\end{lstlisting}

Now to find $P(X > Y > Z)$, we need to work with $(U,V)' = (X-Y,Y-Z)$. 
U and V are both linear functions of X, Y and Z, so let's write the
matrix equation:

We need to have

\begin{equation}
\left (
\begin{array}{r}
X-Y \\
Y-Z \\
\end{array}
\right )
=
A ~
\left (
\begin{array}{c}
X \\
Y \\
Z 
\end{array}
\right )
\end{equation}

so set

\begin{equation}
   A = 
      \left (
      \begin{array}{rrr}
      1 & -1 & 0\\
      0 & 1 & -1   
      \end{array}
      \right )     
\end{equation}

and then proceed as before to find $P(U > 0, V > 0)$.  Now we take
{\bf lower} to be (0,0), and {\bf upper} to be the default values,
$\infty$ in {\bf pmvnorm()}.

\subsection{Correlation Matrices}

The correlation matrix corresponding to a given covariance matrix is
defined as follows.  Element (i,j) is the correlation between the
i$^{th}$ and the j$^{th}$ elements of the given random vector.

Here is R code to compute a correlation matrix from a covariance matrix:

\begin{lstlisting}
covtocorr <- function(covmat) {
   n <- nrow(covmat)
   stddev <- vector(length=n)
   cormat <- matrix(nrow=n,ncol=n)
   for (i in 1:n) {
      stddev[i] <- sqrt(covmat[i,i])
      cormat[i,i] <- 1.0
   }
   for (i in 1:(n-1)) {
      for (j in (i+1):n) {
         tmp <- covmat[i,j] / (stddev[i]*stddev[j])
         cormat[i,j] <- tmp
         cormat[j,i] <- tmp
      }
   }
   return(cormat)
}
\end{lstlisting}
